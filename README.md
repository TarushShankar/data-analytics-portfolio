# data-analytics-portfolio

## Project Overview

This portfolio is meant to encompass my academic as well as personal projects pertaining to Data Analytics and Science. This portfolio is divided into two parts:

1. Academic Projects, and
2. Personal Projects

At the moment of writing the current version of this README Markdown Document, only the Academic Projects have been included into my portfolio.
